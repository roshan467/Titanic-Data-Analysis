# Titanic Data Analysis ðŸš¢  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset  
to understand survival patterns and build a simple predictive model.  

## Steps in the Project  
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn)  
3. Feature Engineering (converting categorical to numerical)  
4. Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Insights  
- Women and children had higher survival rates  
- Higher-class passengers (1st class) had better chances of survival  
- Achieved ~82% accuracy with Logistic Regression
